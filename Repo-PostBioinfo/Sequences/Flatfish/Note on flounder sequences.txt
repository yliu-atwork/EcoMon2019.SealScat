Seq 18 and Seq110 both match 100% to Winter flounder.
However, Seq 18 also matches 100% to Yellowtail flounder while Seq110 matches 100% to American plaice.
This is to say either: 1) there are real biological ASV haplotypes that are not caused by sequencing error.
2)Sequencing error caused the 2 bases difference between Seq110 and Seq18 (the mismatch is along the mid section of sequence tho),
and the perfect match to Seq110 in GenBank identified as winter flounder was a mis-d

Seq490 also matches 100% to Winter and Yellowtail flounder. 
However, Seq490 and Seq 18 have 2-base differences (at the reverse primer site)

If sequencing errors indeed contributed to generating multiple versions of winter/yellowtail flounder and American Plaice sequence,
it is then likely Seq110, Seq 796, and the rest sequences (mainstream version) represent only 3 versions of winter flounder sequences.
Seq 110 (Winter Flounder or American Plaice) differs from the mainstream version by 2 bases. Seq 110 also hits with only 1 ref Winter Flounder.
Seq 796 also differs from the mainstream version by 2 bases.

It turns out Seq 18, Seq 110 and Seq 490 are the only 3 that occurred in EcoMon samples (the rest were only among fecal samples).
Lesson: I need to check ID not from the original tax list, but from the data matrix (be it EcoMon or Seal Scat)with Seq names. 
Seq 18 and Seq 490 are practically the same, without considering the primer site (rever primer site has 1 base difference)
Seq 110 differ from Seq 18 and Seq 490 in the middle section of sequence. It seems real. The ref sequence submitter seems legit as well.
So do Seq 110 and Seq 18 really represent the same species, Winter Flounder?
