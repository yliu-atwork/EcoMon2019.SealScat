Diversity recovered:
A table.

Different volumne:
Compare # of ASV detected just nextSeq)
Compare Shannon index (just next Seq and including MiSeq)
Multivariate analysis clustering pattern (do 1-, 2-, 3- L samples cluster?)

Biogeographical check of all samples (horizontally and vertically):
just nextSeq 2L samples?

CM matters to fish diversity?
Vertical profile of shannon indices of all stations.
